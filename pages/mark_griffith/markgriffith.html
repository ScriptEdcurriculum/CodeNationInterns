                  <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      Mediamath armed me with an entirely new experience and mindset when working in a high profile environment.
                      With the leadership of my manager and fellow coworkers, I was able to not only improve but also add to MediaMaths internal tools.
                      It was something that opened my eyes to how large of a scale software development can take and how long some projects are maintained and improved upon.
                      Looking over the codebase was like seeing a layered story, with each line carrying a bit of history.
                      </p>
                      <p class="">
                      At the start, it felt that I was learning much more than coding. Whether it was by reading the docs or learning directly from my manager, I had to be comfortable with learning on the fly. 
                      There were a number of hangups on the project some of which being internal resources we had to wait on, but eventually, we were able to get into the system. 
                      Once I started to get a feel for the workflow and how to handle searching for issues I was surprised at what we had managed to accomplish.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      While at MediaMath I took part in making a bulk forecaster mvp project.It involved working with technology and languages I 
                      had minimal experience with, but it allowed me to expand my toolset. Not only was I able to test my knowledge,but also use it to
                      build off of the project in an interesting way. It involved using mediamaths data and transforming it into a usable 
                      format,which is something always good to know,and showcasing it in a more concise fashion. When that was done we moved on to   
                      rolling out the different parts in different features.
                    </p>
                    <p class="">
                      One of the greater holdups for me was the lack of instant gratification in certain parts of the project. Coming from my background I
                      mostly worked on projects that often changed drastically. It is this change that often acts like a slight reward to help keep me motivated.
                      For this project however, there were some days where I would seem to make little to no progress which was different for me. Eventually I hit
                      my stride and was making noticible improvements to the project. When the internship started to wind down I finally took a step back to see what
                      was done and truly noticed how far it has come since then.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                       Overall I've learned so much that it is hard to notice how short a time span it truly was. Whether it was the open space of the office or just the general friendliness of the people that surrounded me, it was easy to get comfortable. 
                       MediaMath has a certain
                       tempo to everything that you just really fall into after some time. With the office in the process of a shift in architecture, there was
                       even more leeway to experiment. It was this open experimentation that was probably responsible for most of my growth in this short time span.
                   </p>
                   <p class="">
                       From its generous supply of treats to its select location allowing for the most unique of viewing angles, it was a well-received change from the small routine I found myself in previously. 
                       Considering I now know an entirely new technology that I have ever worked with I am more than happy with the experience. I now have a sense of pride in what I've managed to pull out in such a time frame. 
                       It is a place I would love to find myself in again and hopefully in the future they would be willing to have me.
