                    <p class="p">
                      I'm a rising sophomore currently attending Dickinson College. I'm double majoring in computer science and math and minoring in sociology.
                      <br> My favorite hobbies are biking, writing, painting, and finding good yet cheap places to eat around the city.
                      By 2021, I hope to graduate with my computer science degree, have studied my junior year abroad, and have a job at a startup as a software engineer. After I've acheived this I hope to begin travelling to other countries, I want to start with the countries in South America and continue to other countries.
                      <br> I've done previous internships at ThoughtWorks and Rent the Runway. This summer I was able to intern at DataDog.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="p">
                      DataDog is a company that offers a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform.
                      The best part about the internship was the free food and unlimited snacks, of course.
                      Besides that, throughout these past five weeks at DataDog I was able to work on the company's corp website.
                      I had the opportunity to contribute to the company and learn more about the way their site works and ways in which they improve their site every day.
                      Having the chance to meet cool, nice, and incredible people who made my experience 100x better. Couldn't ask for a better team and company.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="p">
                     As I mentioned above, at DataDog I worked on the corporate website, which uses a static site generator as their framework. I was able to work on the website's case studies pages. 
                     <br> One part of this project was to edit the further readings section, in other words the related posts, at the bottom of the page and make sure it didn't only link to DataDog's blog post, which was how it originally was. They wanted that section to be linked to DataDog's resource pages as well as external pages. 
                     Due to the company's growth this change was needed because there is now more information that can be linked in the further readings section. 
                     In order to acheive this new front-matter had to be added to the markdown file and this front-matter was called on the html page.
                     The second part of this project was to make sure each quote on a case study page has a gradient block on the side which fit the company's brand color. 
                     The final part was to make the sure the quotation marks weren't hard corded, this was a necessary change because due to more quotes being included in new case study pages it's crucial to cite the author. 
                     To make the second and third parts of the project possible there was new front-matter added, the scss file was edited in order to remove the hard-coded quotes, a default gradient was added, and the cite was hard-coded instead.
                     The css was directly added to the html file and lastly I added the quotation marks as well as the author to the pages' markdown file.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="p">
                        During this five week internship I was able to learn how to use hugo and the many layers that it has. I had the chance to meet people from other teams and learn more about their role at DataDog.
                        Being a part of the websites team, or better known as guacamole, gave me a chance to communicate with my team if I was ever stuck and needed clarification.
                        Having a remote manager was definitely a new yet good experience because I got a glimpse of what my future job will be like.
