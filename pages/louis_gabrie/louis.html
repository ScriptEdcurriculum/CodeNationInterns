                    <p class="first-text-section">
                      I have been programming for 2 years, with experience in a variety of coding languagues like: 
                      javascript, python, and jquery. Being the most proficient in javacript, and jquery -
                      as far as the backend aspects go. However, for front-end I am most proficent in html and css. 
                      I also have other hobbies like: photography, skateboarding, and tinkering.<br /> <br /> 
                      I've been skateboarding for about 2 years as well, with my favorite board being the longboard 
                      - but i'll like to try riding a boosted board. As for tinkering,
                      I like to tinker with Ardunios - making side projects when I can. 
                      As for photography, I like to take photos of things that catch my eye from a particular perspective. 
                     A majority of the time I often take photos on my phone. 
                   </p>
                   
                   <br />
                   <h2 class="section-heading">Hobbies</h2>
                   <h5 class="section-heading">Photography</h5>
                   <p>
                     Often I like taking pictures of NYC's horizon,
                     but from time to time, I tend to take pictures of anything that looks appealing to me.
                     Some times I convince myself that I can get a wickedly good angle, and the next I know I'm angling away. 
                     I like to try different angles as it gives my pictures life, and I also try to change up my style here and there. 
                     Be sure to check out my instagram, linked above, for some sample pictures.
                   </p>
                    <h5 class="section-heading">Tinkering</h5>
                   <p>
                     I like to tinker with things from time to time, varying from Arduinios, to iPhones, or Computers.
                     When I'm not familiar with a contraption, I tend to open them carefully, while sometimes making a 
                     corresponding blueprint as a future reference. However, most times it would be to repair the contraption,
                     or to take parts from it.
                   </p>
                    <h5 class="section-heading">Skateboarding</h5>
                   <p>
                     I started skating during my first year of high school.
                     At first, I was pretty worried with getting hurt, 
                     but that didn't stop me from wanting to accomplish my goal of mastering the skateboard. 
                     At first, I did it because I saw something more from skateboarding, as if it was a form of relaxtion. 
                     Not just a form of transportion, and that's the same now, but now I feel like my thoughts don't feel strained when I skate.

                    <h5 class="section-heading">My First Day</h5>
                    <p class="">
                      On my first day I arrived late, due to being in the wrong office. 
                      And at once I thought it was because I went to the wrong address, 
                      but I looked up the note I wrote to myself and their was 
                      the address I was at - it can't be a mistake. 
                      At first I didn't know how to get to the 9th floor because the elevator didn't work, and the staircase was locked,
                      so I asked a maintance man that works in the building, and shortly after discovered that the company moved out.
                      I then searched for the company on google - panicking, not knowing what to do. 
                      Fortunately, I saw an address that I have not seen before, so I decided to try it out. 
                      When I arrived I saw everyone from the company, and was relieved - all to be crushed by the painful realization that 
                      they were all in a meeting and I had to join them. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                     You are probably wondering why I had to go to a meeting, since it's my first day. And I had asked myself the same question over 
                     and over in my head, as I stood in front of the the offices front door. I didn't want to intrude, so I stood there for a few minutes
                     until the guy who interviewed me, the CTF of the company, allowed me to join in the meeting. Ten minutes later....
                     I was asking myself - what's worst: Not being in the right office? or Being in a meeting for about 3 hours? 
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="section-heading">Overall Experience</h5>
                    <p> 
                     Before the internship, I knew there had to be more to programming then marking up websites 
                     and styling them until they become appealing. However, I didn't know what it was, so I tried looking into back-end. 
                     I first dived into back-end programming during a internship I took at City Tech for Mechincal Engineering, with Java.
                     I didn't use Java much, but I was exposed to the possiblities it comes with when used with a microcontroller - like an Adruino. 
                     Afterwards, I didn't get to experiment with back-end programming much, except for learning how to use APIs to pull in data to a site.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                     It wasn't until the internship at ALICE that I was able to learn a little about Databases, Creating APIs, and about how to make real time updates
                     to a site to make web applications. The people at ALICE are also amazing, and make the company feel more like a home where they all have a one common objective
                     at hand, while being kind and helping each other along the way. My internship was only 6 weeks, but I learned a lot, and got the opportunity to a get a feel as to what a 
                     around the clock developer feels like. ScriptEd is truly amazing for allowing students, not yet in college, to get hands-on experience at a tech company.

                      Things to know before reading: <br />
                      - Jira is a productivity tool that breaks takes down tasks, features, and bugs into issues and an epic is a collection of this issues. <br />
                      - A feature branching workflow is used at ALICE, with environments to test the features made <br />
                      - Features are made in feature branches, which are binded to issues. These issues are then binded into certain epics, whereas they each epic has their own branch. <br /> 
                    </p>
                     <p>
                     The major problem presented is that at ALICE, 
                     we are uncertain that the features/bug-fixes binded to a 
                     Epic made it to the Epic environment for testing, and is qualified to be there. 
                     A high certainty that these features/bug-fixes binded to a Epic branch made it to the Epic environment 
                     for testing is critical in keeping clients happy, while minimizing the amount of time wasted double checking
                     the Epic for code complete, or while testing an unstable Epic environment. 
                     Issues should be linked with code and vice versus, giving us the certainty that all code is tracked in Jira. 
                     Along with that, all issues statuses should match the statuses of their code, 
                     giving us the certainty that no code is left behind. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     In order to handle this problem, a web application called branch-monitor was built, 
                     to decrease the amount of time allotted to managing the stability of a epic environment, 
                     while giving the user reassurance that all Jiras have code 
                     and their designated items in the stage they are at in their life cycle. 
                     Worked with a partner and mainly worked with a software stack called, MEAN. 
                     The software stack allowed us to handle real time updates to the user interface
                     from the Bitbucket and Jira Cloud RESTful APIs to deliver information about a particular epic to the user.
                    </p>

                         As you can see from the directory tree on the left side, I was working on some pocs to get 
                         comfortable working with the BitBucket & Jira API and with Nodejs. The file opened is just a notes file
                         but the contents of the file is important. The content in the file is the data model for the jiras, after they are spit out 
                         to the the view of the branch-monitor site.
