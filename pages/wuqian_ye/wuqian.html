                            I am an alumna of The High School of Fashion Industries and I graduated in
                            2018. I started with ScriptEd Foundation Class in my high school junior year.
                            I got in touch with basic coding knowledge in Foundation Class and learned
                            basic coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.Later I attended the
                            Summer Academy and learned Bootstrap. I continued on to the advanced class in
                            my senior year.

                        <p class="description">
                            I was interning in Etsy and this is my first internship. I had the chance to
                            work in an office setting and get in contact with many different people. On the
                            first day, everyone made me feel welcomed, everyone is kind and easygoing. The
                            office was as strict as I expected, I got to relax, work in different places and
                            have the freedom to do the things I want.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description">
                            In the first week, I spent the time learning the tools and different libraries
                            that I had never work with. I struggled to understand everything, so when my
                            manager told me that it is ok to not fully understand everything, I really freed
                            myself from the pressure.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description">
                            In the following weeks, I was using Visual Studio Code and node.js for my project.
                            The first stage of the project was the hardest. I still don't fully understand what I
                            was doing, I was simply copying and pasting codes. There were also security problems
                            for Slack to access Etsy's internal API. I knew there were problems but I just cannot
                            figure out the problem. Thanks to my manager, all the problems were solved, it is
                            impossible to solve all those problems by myself. With my manager's help, I was able
                            to come out with a good product.

                        <p class="description">
                            During this internship, I worked on building a Slack Bot. Slack Bot is a type of
                            Slack App designed to interact with users via conversation. It is also a simple
                            way to interact with apps and get work done right from your team chat. I built a
                            Slack Bot named Toolkit Bot" and it is built with Slack Real Time Message API
                            (RTM API) and Web API.
                        </p>
                        <p class="description">
                            Toolkit Bot is connected to Etsy's internal API, it will be able to search the
                            API with a given parameter and return the search results in the conversation. It
                            has three search modes. The default search returns top result from Version One and
                            Version Two of the Toolkit. The second mode is adding "all" to the search, which
                            returns all results from both Versions. The third mode can indicate the number of
                            results returned from the search by simply adding "//num" at the end of the search.

                        <p class="description">
                            The key takeaway from this internship is that I learned so much about node.js and
                            how to use different libraries. At first, I struggled to understand what I was
                            learning. Everything was messed up in my brain, I don't understand how they wor
                            and how they are connected to each other. Then as I slowly get to understand the
                            process, many things start to get clear for me. Even though the process of learning
                            new knowledge was hard, but the sense of accomplishment after understanding what I
                            was learning will also be proportional to the hardship that I went through. And it
                            is also very important to work with others and seek help when needed.
