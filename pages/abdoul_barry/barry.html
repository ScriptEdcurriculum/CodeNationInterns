                    <p class="">
                     My name is Abdoul Barry and I joined ScriptEd 2 years ago at my school as an elective class. 
                     It was the best decision I made in high school since I have always dreamt to be a programming nerd.
                     All my experience in the tech experience has then derived from the knowlegde I am acquiring from ScriptEd. 
                     It has been an amazing way from walking into big tech companies for mentorships to internships, ScriptEd has meant the opportunity's glimmer to me.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class=""> The New Lab could be described as an indoor startup community. It is the ultimate place to see inventions from very visionary startup. I couldn’t believe that the place is actually located in Brooklyn.
                 The environment and the way people work at the New Lab, redefines the workplace and has change my perspective on being a programmer. A totally flexible schedule such as lunch breaks, 
                 or moving around to find a new place to seat brings your productivity to another level. You don’t have to seat at a desk writing code for the entire day, as you can see on my profile picture, a typical day could also look like that.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class=""> I worked on a game that would let you bet on the Ether price which was actually interestingly unstable lately. 
                    In order to make the game <a href="http://barrytech.github.io/darecoin/"> DareCoin </a> depend on the blockchain, I had to write a smart 
                    contract in solidity. Well, the whole purpose of a smart contract is to allow a transaction without
                    a trusted third party. It is like an automated protocol that goes active once certains requirements are verified.
                    However, what makes the blockchain so interesting and reliable is because once the smart contract is deployed, 
                    there is no way to temper with it or change anything.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                     If you are reading this is, then I know you probably love the tech industry and somehow write some code. 
                     I have always said I wanted to be a software developer but I wasn’t sure what type. Now, I have the answer, 
                     I want to be a blockchain developer. Blockchain is actually that growing new technology that many companies are incorporating. 
                     Now is the best time to get in, in order to be shape once it becomes universalized because eventually
                     it is going be, one day soon.                      
                     Based on what I have learned so far, I am convinced that Blockchain is the future and one day 
                     soon, it will be impossible to run anindustry without using the blockchain 
                     because it extremely secure. It redefines what trust means to our society.
