                    <p class="">
                      I'm an alumni of High School of Fashion Industries. In this school, there are three majors (fashion design, business, and art majors) and I'm fashion design major.
                      I had graduated with the Apparel and Textile NOCTI certificate, showing that I have all the skills I need to work in the fashion industry or work under a fashion company.
                      It was my pleasure to be in this high school because it gaves me many opportunities such as constructing garments and having my garments featured in the fashion shows. 
                     <br><br>
                      Most importantly, it gave me the chance to join the ScriptEd program. ScriptEd program had led me explore what it's like in the tech industry and get me interested in coding.
                      I attended this program during my Junior year and really love it, so I continued attending Summer Academy and the Advanced class in MLB. As I attend more classes, it made me 
                      realize that I like to code and I want to try to merge fashion design with website design or development. Indeed I'll continue to code when attending Hunter College during
                      the fall semester by majoring in computer science.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Internship Experience</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      On the first day of the internship, my manager made me feel welcome. I thought the company would be very strict, but actually, it's very
                      easygoing and enjoyable. In the HSBC tech company, I'm the youngest in my team so everyone treated me friendly and always asked if I need help.
                      I spent my first week there learning what my team is, what it does and how to code with excel VBA since the language is different from what we 
                      use at ScriptEd classes. When they introduce Microsoft excel to me, I was surprised since I used Microsoft Excel very often to grid data, but 
                      I never know that you can code using Microsoft Excel. 
                      <br><br>
                      I experienced using Microsoft for one week and then start working on the project my manager gave me.
                      The project was difficult, but my colleague had assisted me with how the basic works and gave me confidence. She supported me and say I can do it.
                      With my teammate's support, I was able to finish the project during my fourth week of the internship at HSBC. I have shown my manager what I accomplished 
                      and explained to my manager what I did and how I code it. My manager was very pleased that I finish my project and had gladly asked what I wanted to 
                      do in my last week. He said he can ask people from other teams to explain to me what they do if I'm interested. I told him that I'm interested in website
                      designing, so he spends the last week showing me the HSBC websites and teaching me more about HTML, CSS, and javascript.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What I Worked On</h2>
                    <p class="">
                      During the first week of the internship, I'm learning how to code with Excel VBA by practicing it on the laptop and reading articles about how beginners use 
                      Excel VBA and what are the basic functions of VBA programming? After the training, I worked on a project that creates functions for the stock market team. 
                      The functions created are used to calculate the data they need and send the information to Bloomberg. These functions make their work much easier and more convenient.
                      <br><br>
                      In details, there is an insert file function that when someone imports a file, it would read the selected data (instrument name, cusip, and maturity months) in the
                      file and used these selected data to do calculations (Cusip and price). The calculations are formulated by the other functions created and after it's done with the
                      calculations, it would populate the data onto the prices page. Lastly, there is a function that submits all the data to Bloomberg. This project is way different from 
                      what we did in ScriptEd because there are only functions and no decorations.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p class="">
                     HSBC is not a strict environment, it's very easy-going and relaxing and I learned many new skills. I got new skills that can help me get a job easily. Excel VBA is a 
                     skill most bank tech companies look at when they hire people. In addition, during the five weeks at HSBC, my teammates have discussed with me their experience and what
                     brings them to the tech industry. After talking to them, it helped me decide what I want to do in the future. I decide to stay in the tech industry and find a job at a 
                     tech company.  
                      <br><br>
                     I have also learned more new skills during the last week of the internship when I finished my project. My manager had asked me what I'm interested in doing, so he can
                     get someone to teach or talk about it. I was interested in website designing or developing, so he teaches what they did for the HSBC website. He taught me more about 
                     Github, server site, javascript frameworks (spring, Node.js) and told me to research more about it. Lastly, it was an amazing opportunity to be at HSBC because it's a 
                     very informative and amazing place to work at.
